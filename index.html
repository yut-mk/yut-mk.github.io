        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          As a UCLA student in Bioengineering and Physics, I work at the intersection of computational methods, engineering design, and natural sciences. On campus I have involved myself in hands-on engineering projects, as well as many research experiences that have given me a plethora of technical skills. I enjoy learning and thinking at a theoretical level, and applying science and engineering principles to real world problems, whether that be in ML, signal processing, or engineering design and fabrication. Looking forward, I hope to grow my technical experience through engineering intern roles in these areas.

    <!-- TruBalance Stand -->
    <div class="project">
      <h4>TruBalance Stand (In Progress)</h4>
      <p><strong>Skills &amp; Tools:</strong> Constraint-Driven Design, Jupyter, SolidWorks, Prototyping, 3D Printing</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a rigid tablet stand defined by a curve that rests at static equilibrium for any angle at which the stand can be placed.</li>
        <li>Considered physical and geometrical constraints to work out an initial design concept, reducing to only two constraint equations.</li>
        <li>Used Jupyter to numerically solve for constrained parameters, allowing for easy material and dimensional customizability.</li>
        <li>Modeled the design in SolidWorks to allow prototyping</li>
        <li>Currently creating prototypes using 3D printing, making practical and design improvements with each iteration.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Flagellum Image Classification -->
    <div class="project">
      <h4>Flagellum Image Classification</h4>
      <p><strong>Skills &amp; Tools:</strong> CNN, Julia, Pluto, Image Processing, Bash</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Built a deep learning pipeline to classify 10,000+ bacterial images with high throughput and reproducibility.</li>
        <li>Designed a streamlined interface for manual labeling, enabling 600+ images/hour for training data generation.</li>
        <li>Tuned model architectures to boost accuracy and training efficiency, achieving 50%+ accuracy improvements.</li>
        <li>Experimented with diverse datasets and processing, boosting model accuracy by 30%.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- EEG Seizure Detection -->
    <div class="project">
      <h4>EEG Seizure Detection</h4>
      <p><strong>Skills &amp; Tools:</strong> DWT, Jupyter, SciPy, SVM, PCA</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Used machine learning methods to create software that automatically classifies EEG as seizure/non-seizure.</li>
        <li>Processed the signals two ways: one using DWT (discrete wavelet transform) and the other using PCA.</li>
        <li>Used SVM to classify EEG signals, achieving 96% accuracy, 90% precision, and 90% recall.</li>
      </ul>
